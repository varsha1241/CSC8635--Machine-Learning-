### Machine Learning Pipelines for Classification, Regression, and NLP  
This repository contains my solutions for a machine learning coursework involving three datasets:  

1. **Classification (FARS Dataset)**:  
   - Performed EDA, data normalization, and cross-validation on the US road traffic accident dataset.  
   - Developed and evaluated four machine learning pipelines to classify accident severity, incorporating techniques like feature selection, class imbalance correction, and hyperparameter tuning.  
   - Achieved optimal results using [insert best-performing model].  

2. **Regression (Bacteria Growth Dataset)**:  
   - Predicted bacterial growth rate parameters (`a`, `mu`, `tau`, `a0`) using regression models.  
   - Explored feature engineering, normalization, and hyperparameter optimization to improve model performance.  
   - Best results were achieved with [insert best-performing model].  

3. **NLP (News Articles Dataset)**:  
   - Conducted EDA and built two text transformation pipelines to preprocess news article data.  
   - Determined the number of distinct news article types using clustering and visualization techniques.  
   - Focused on optimizing text representation (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings) for machine learning.  

**Key Skills**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLP, Cross-Validation, Hyperparameter Tuning, Feature Engineering.
